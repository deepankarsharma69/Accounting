This is the performance summary of the data which has been downloaded from GitHub for analysis.
The **Excel file** is in the **CSV** format and the file has been directly imported into Power BI platform to analyse it directly.
While analysing the data in **Power BI** different types measures has been created using **DAX** without making any changes in the orignal data.
Some of measures which has been created are **Revenue Vs Target Amount in numbers and in percentage seprately**.
Used different type of slicer like **Segment, Industry, Vertical, Account Name and Product Category** to make the analysis more interactive.
I have also added the overall summary of the data to have an overall view.
I have also created **Segment vise summary** and **Product category vise summary**.
