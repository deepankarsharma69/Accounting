## Overall Performance Measurement of the Employees 
This is the performance summary of the data which has been downloaded from GitHub for analysis.
The **Excel file** is in the **CSV** format and the file has been directly imported into Power BI platform to analyse it directly.
While analysing the data in **Power BI** different types measures has been created using **DAX** without making any changes in the orignal data.
Some of measures which has been created are **Revenue Vs Target Amount in numbers and in percentage seprately**.
Used different type of slicer like **Segment, Industry, Vertical, Account Name and Product Category** to make the analysis more interactive.
I have also added the overall summary of the data to have an overall view.
I have also created **Segment vise summary** and **Product category vise summary**.

## Car Price Analysis
This is the overall Car price analysis using **Power BI** and **Excel CSV** file.
First the **Excel CSV** file has been ownloaded from the Git Hub and directly uploaded on the POWER BI.
While analysisng the data on Power BI different slicer has been used to filter the data like **Engine Type**, **Cylinder Number**, **Fuel Type**, **Phases**.
I have also plotted the regression line to show the **Price VS Engine Size**.
In the last I have shown the overall summary of the overall data and heighleted the **Price prediction column** and **Price** with the change in price.
